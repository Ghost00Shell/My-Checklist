# Awesome-Application-Security-Checklist
  If you are designing, creating, testing  your web/mobile application with security in mind, this Checklist of counter-measures can be a good starting point 




##### AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS (Signup/Signin/2 Factor/Password reset) 
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere.
- [ ] Store password hashes using `Bcrypt` (no salt necessary - `Bcrypt` does it for you).
- [ ] Destroy the session identifier after `logout`.  
- [ ] Destroy all active sessions on reset password (or offer to).  
- [ ] Must have the `state` parameter in OAuth2.
- [ ] No open redirects after successful login or in any other intermediate redirects.
- [ ] When parsing Signup/Login input, sanitize for javascript://, data://, CRLF characters. 
- [ ] Set secure, httpOnly cookies.
- [ ] In Mobile `OTP` based mobile verification, do not send the OTP back in the response when `generate OTP` or `Resend OTP`  API is called.
- [ ] Limit attempts to `Login`, `Verify OTP`, `Resend OTP` and `generate OTP` APIs for a particular user. Have an exponential backoff set or/and something like a captcha based challenge.
- [ ] Check for randomness of reset password token in the emailed link or SMS.
- [ ] Set an expiration on the reset password token for a reasonable period.
- [ ] Expire the reset token after it has been successfully used.



##### USER DATA & AUTHORIZATION
- [ ] Any resource access like, `my cart`, `my history` should check the logged in user's ownership of the resource using session id.
- [ ] Serially iterable resource id should be avoided. Use `/me/orders` instead of `/user/37153/orders`. This acts as a sanity check in case you forgot to check for authorization token. 
- [ ] `Edit email/phone number` feature should be accompanied by a verification email to the owner of the account. 
- [ ] Any upload feature should sanitize the filename provided by the user. Also, for generally reasons apart from security, upload to something like S3 (and post-process using lambda) and not your own server capable of executing code.  
- [ ] `Profile photo upload` feature should sanitize all the `EXIF` tags also if not required.
- [ ] For user ids and other ids, use [RFC compliant ](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) `UUID` instead of integers. You can find an implementation for this for your language on Github.
- [ ] JWT are awesome. Use them if required for your single page app/APIs.
